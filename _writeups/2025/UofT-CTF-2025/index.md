## Thoughts:
Crypto was too hard :(  
Pwn went really well though! Solved 4/6, definitely could've solved the hardest pwn with a bit more time (I figured out the right idea of house of tangerine + how to leak heap and libc, but ran out of time to finish implementing unfortunately)  
Quite enjoyed the pwn category this CTF (probably one of my favorite pwn categories out of all CTFs I've played), and definitely learned a lot!
