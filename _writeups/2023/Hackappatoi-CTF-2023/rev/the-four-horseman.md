Let's head over to [Dogbolt](https://dogbolt.org/?id=f716f53f-44ad-42f7-8f53-60b52a5358ff#Hex-Rays=158) to decompile this.  

Immediately, in the Hex-Rays decompilation, I found this string:  

    upgs{lbher_ernql_gb_fgbc_gur_ncbpnylcfr}

Hm. Seems to be encrypted. Maybe it's just some ROT offset?  

Heading over to [https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher) and using ROT13 gives us the flag!
