I'm not sure how secure this protocol is but as long as we update the password, I'm sure everything will be fine ðŸ˜Š

We're given a PCAP file. It seems like there's something involved with a password, so I used Ctrl+F to search for the string 'password' in the packet bytes with Wireshark. I immediately found a packet with the following information.  

    Hi cat,

    This flag is really important so I had to encrypt it in case it falls into the wrong hands.

    You already know the FTP password.. Just use the same here, but update it accordingly ;)

Hm. So there's a flag being transferred and a password used. Since Ctrl+F with password returns nothing more of importance, let's first look for the flag.  
I used Ctrl+F for 'flag' and found the following packet:  

    -rwxrw-rw-   1 crypto   crypto       7616 Oct 29 12:50 README.md
    -rwxrw-rw-   1 crypto   crypto        236 Oct 29 12:49 flag.zip
    -rwxrw-rw-   1 crypto   crypto        190 Oct 29 12:50 reminder.txt

Seems like the result of an ```ls -l``` command, and it includes something called flag.zip! Continuing to Ctrl+F for "flag", I found another suspicious packet following a packet described as "Request: RETR flag.zip". Taking a look at the packet data, I noticed that it certainly looked like a zip file -- it had the PK file header! (\x50\x4b is PK in ASCII)

I created a simple Python script to write this to a file and voila, I got a zip file!  

```py
import binascii

s = '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'
f = open('warmup/overthewire1/flagzip', 'wb')
for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
    f.write(binascii.unhexlify(s[i:i+2]))
f.close()
```

But, only problem was, when I tried to extract flag.txt from the file, it asked me for a password. Right, the message also included something about a password. Where could this be?  
Well, my previous search for the string 'password' returned nothing, but there's something odd about what was said in the message. They specified that it was an FTP password... why?  
Maybe that's a hint to filter for FTP packets! I filtered for FTP packets and found the password:  

    5up3r_53cur3_p455w0rd_2022

I went back to my zip file and put in the password and... got it wrong?  
I took a look back at the message. It included a final statement that the user should "update it [the password] accordingly". This password contains 2022, what if we change it to 2023?  
With the new password of 5up3r_53cur3_p455w0rd_2023, I unzipped flag.txt and got the flag!
