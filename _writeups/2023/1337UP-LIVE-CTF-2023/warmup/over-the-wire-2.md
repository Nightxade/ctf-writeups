Learning the lessons from the previous failed secure file transfer attempts, CryptoCat and 0xM4hm0ud found a new [definitely secure] way to share information ðŸ˜Š

We're given a PCAP file. Similar to Over the Wire 1, let's Ctrl+F for some strings in hopes of finding something. I eventually ended up looking for 'share' because of its inclusion in the problem description, which returned the following SMTP/IMF packet (email).  

    Hi CryptoCat,

    It's been a long time since we last saw each other, and I've been thinking about our friendship. I believe it's important for us to stay connected and share important things in a way that only you and I can understand.

    I wanted to remind you that we need to pay more attention to our communications, especially when it comes to discussing crucial matters. Sometimes, we might need to hide our messages in plain sight, using our own secret language. As you know SMTP isn't secure as you think!

    It's like we're on a treasure hunt, and the treasure is our bond. You know the drill - for our important stuff, we'll need to hide it somewhere unique, somewhere only we can find it.

    Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Let's make our conversations more interesting and secure.

    Best,
    0xM4hm0ud

From this, I realized that these two were definitely communicating via email. I filtered for 'imf' packets (since SMTP referred to other packets related to emails), and got the following packets:  

    Hey 0xM4hm0ud,

    It's great to hear from you! I completely agree that we should keep our conversations private and intriguing. Our special bond deserves nothing less. I'm up for the challenge!

    I've been thinking about a unique way we can communicate securely. 
    Maybe we could use a combination of our favorite books, movies or pets as a code, or even a simple cipher? Let's brainstorm ideas and keep our messages hidden from prying eyes.

    Looking forward to rekindling our friendship in this exciting and mysterious way.

    Talk to you soon,
    CryptoCat

    Hi CryptoCat,

    I want to buy a cat. I know you already have some nice cats.
    What do you think about this cat? 
    Let me know as soon as possible!

    Hey 0xM4hm0ud,

    I love all kind of cats, but I prefer this cat. 

    CryptoCat

(This one had a PNG file attached, encoded in base64)

I wrote a short python script to create the files locally:  

```py
import base64

print(len(jpg), len(png))

jpgstr = ''
pngstr = ''
for i in range(0, len(jpg), 2):
    if i % 100000 == 0:
        print(i)
    jpgstr += chr(int(jpg[i:i+2], 16))

f = open('warmup/overthewire2/cat.jpg', 'wb')
f.write(base64.b64decode(jpgstr))
f.close()


for i in range(0, len(png), 2):
    pngstr += chr(int(png[i:i+2], 16))
f = open('warmup/overthewire2/cat.png', 'wb')
f.write(base64.b64decode(pngstr))
f.close()
```

(Note that extracting the JPEG takes a really long time, which I probably should have realized hinted towards not needing to use it).  

Once I had the files, I noticed that they both seemed like plain images. Maybe they're hiding some data with Least Significant Bit Steganography?  

Using stegsolve, I eventually used 'Data Extract' to extract data from all 0 bits of Red, Green, and Blue of the PNG file, resulting in the flag at the very top of the hex dump!
