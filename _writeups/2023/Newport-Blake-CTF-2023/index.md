## Thoughts:
First high school CTF!  

Overall, I think I did quite well with this CTF! However, I definitely had some major problems with spending far too long on problems that could have taken only 30 minutes max. *cough cough* webcam and Shifty Sands *cough cough*. I also missed galleria because I didn't include a single `/` D:

I think I could have done better, and I am honestly a little disappointed considering this is probably the most time I have ever spent on a single CTF. My key takeaways are:  

1. I am not good at pwn... I need to learn some basic ROP and heap at the very least.  

2. Don't spend too long on a single challenge. Linkedout 2 (I still hate that challenge) and webcam killed my brain Saturday and Sunday. 

3. Take breaks! Related to the previous one, but it's not good to just keep going at a challenge without any progress. It destroys my mental :(
