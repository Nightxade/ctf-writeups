## Thoughts:
Didn't have as much time to play this one, but still had fun! Crypto section kinda carried my score. I definitely wish I could've had more time to spend on web and rev, as I ended up with 0 solves in those categories ;-;. I also probably shouldn't have only solved 2 pwn challenges, given how it seemed so easy, so hopefully I do better at pwn next time.
