## Thoughts:
First time playing with a team (reCAPTCHA the Flag). Unfortunately, the other members didn't end up having too much time to play, so it ended up not panning out for us. Personally, however, I did quite decently on the crypto section! I am a bit disappointed that I couldn't see how to use LLL for crypto/L4ugh, as I would've solved it if I realized that, so I definitely do need to get better at lattice crypto. Also, infra kinda sucked which was frustrating but thankfully it was all fixed eventually. Had fun!
