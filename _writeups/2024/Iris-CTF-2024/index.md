Placement: #88/1207

## Thoughts:
Turns out I'm a speed demon in the first few hours of the CTF, because I was top ~10 after that despite starting like an hour late. Still ended up placing quite well though, mainly because of my two solves in misc that made up almost half of my points (Sir Scope and Name that song 3). Integral Communication was also a cool crypto challenge that showed that my CryptoHack grinding actually paid off!
