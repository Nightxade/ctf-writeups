## Thoughts:
Best CTF yet with my team reCAPTCHA the Flag! I completed all of the crypto except one this CTF. To be honest, the crypto this CTF was easy (except for crypto/Forgery, which was rev + crypto, and I could not get past the rev part). As a result, I ended up contributing a lot to the other categories, mainly misc and forensics. misc/CCV a pretty interesting and unique challeng. forensics/Gibberish, on the other hand, took me so long... (I started 11 pm and stayed up until 5 am working on it). But overall, quite a nice CTF, and high quality challenges. And of course an amazing result for the team :)
