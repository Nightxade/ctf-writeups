We can't speak French and just say what we see.

We also don't know what underscores are add them yourself.

put ONLY the final decrypted cipher in bcactf{}, no intermediate steps

key - vinegar

cipher 0 - mmqaonv

cipher 1 - seooizmt

cipher 2 - bdoloeinbdjmmyg <- THIS ONE

The challenge description hints towards Vigenere's cipher. We can just use an online decryption tool.  

Each cipher, decrypted, becomes the key for the next cipher.
