[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)  

This was the CTF I first started off with! In early July 2023 I was introduced to picoCTF and everything just kept going from there. It's a really great beginner's CTF that I personally have learned a lot from. As of late November 2023 have not solved all of the challenges, but I hope someday I will fully complete the site's challenges!  

If you're interested in getting into CTFs, I highly recommend picoCTF as a starter.
