The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.  
Check [this](http://saturn.picoctf.net:63195/) out.

After exploring a little bit through the website files, I found nothing to indicate a possible flag. Given the name of the challenge, Roboto Sans, and its description, “The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website,” I figured checking the `robots.txt` file might be worth a shot.  

In short, the `robots.txt` file is a file that allows or prohibits website crawlers from accessing a website’s URLs. Essentially, this can allow websites to prevent certain web pages from showing up in search engine results.  

Check [http://saturn.picoctf.net:63195/robots.txt](http://saturn.picoctf.net:63195/robots.txt), which will show the following:

    User-agent *
    Disallow: /cgi-bin/
    Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

    ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
    anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
    svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
    Disallow: /wp-admin/


Some of it appears to be base64 encoded. Let’s try to decode it using an online tool.  
It should return the following:  

    flag1.txtjs/myfi
    js/myfile.txt

Eventually, checking [http://saturn.picoctf.net:63195/js/myfile.txt](http://saturn.picoctf.net:63195/js/myfile.txt) should return the flag
